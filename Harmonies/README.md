# Harmonies

Harmony upgrades allow for all applicable pre-RB3 songs to be sang with up to 3 people via the addition of harmony vocal tubes. All harmony files (with the exception of the forbidden harmonies) have been authored by [Rock Band: Harmonies Project (RBHP)](https://github.com/FujiSkunk/rbhp). However, many of these upgrades contained bugs such as lyrics displaying twice or vocal tubes being disconnected, so I went ahead and tweaked all of them. These fixed upgrades can also be found built-in to another RB3 project, [Rock Band 3 Deluxe](https://github.com/jnackmclain/rock-band-3-deluxe).

# Installation

Installing one harmony upgrade is a rather lengthy and involved process (even moreso if you are playing on a retail console). For this reason, in order to play all the upgraded harmonies, I highly recommend downloading and installing Rock Band 3 Deluxe instead - it has every last one of my fixed upgrade files (which I implemented so you don't have to), plus additional quality-of-life upgrades and features.
