# Acknowledgements
Finally, I would like to note some other teams as well as individual authors who have done excellent work in tweaking RB3 to be the best game it can be:
- [Rock Band: Harmonies Project (RBHP)](https://github.com/FujiSkunk/rbhp), for initially authoring legacy song harmony parts more than a decade before the creation of this repository, as well as continuing to author pro string and key upgrades to this day.
- [Rock Band 3 Deluxe](https://github.com/jnackmclain/rock-band-3-deluxe), for sharing the same spirit of making RB3 the best game it can be by allowing upgrades beyond additional song parts, such as customizable song sources and venue frame rate for players, and instrument spoofing and enhanced autoplay for chart authors.
- [Ruggy](https://therogerland.tumblr.com/proguide), for creating an excellent written guide on how to author pro string charts, as well as contributing several of his own pro string upgrades.
- [Ziggy](https://code.google.com/archive/p/ziggy-pro-editor/), for authoring many, many pro guitar charts in RB3's prime - several of which were used as bases for pro string upgrades in this repo.
