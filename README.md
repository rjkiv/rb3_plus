# Acknowledgements
Finally, I would like to note some other teams as well as individual authors who have done excellent work in tweaking RB3 to be the best game it can be:
-[Rock Band: Harmonies Project (RBHP)](https://github.com/FujiSkunk/rbhp), for initially authoring legacy song harmony parts more than a decade before the creation of this repository.
-[Rock Band 3 Deluxe](https://github.com/jnackmclain/rock-band-3-deluxe), for sharing the same spirit of making RB3 the best game it can be by allowing upgrades beyond additional song parts, such as customizable song sources and venue frame rate.
-[Ruggy](https://therogerland.tumblr.com/proguide), for creating an excellent written guide on how to author pro string charts, as well as contributing several of his own pro string upgrades.
-[Ziggy](https://code.google.com/archive/p/ziggy-pro-editor/), for authoring many, many pro guitar charts in RB3's prime - several of which were used as bases for pro string upgrades in this repo.
