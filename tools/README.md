# Auto-insert your pro upgrade into RPCS3 for testing
Assuming you have a new midi/dta in the appropriate Pro Strings folder ready to go, this script allows you to automatically place your upgrade into RPCS3 so you can get right into testing.
Fill out the config.json with your system's specific RPCS3 directory (use /'s instead of \\'s), and then run this script with the argument --shortname your_song_shortname.
