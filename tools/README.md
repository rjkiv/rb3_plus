# Auto-insert your pro upgrade into RPCS3 for testing
Assuming you have a new midi/dta in the appropriate Pro Strings folder ready to go, this script allows you to automatically place your upgrade into RPCS3 so you can get right into testing.

Fill out the `config.json` with your system's specific RPCS3 directory (IMPORTANT: make sure you use /'s instead of \\'s when filling out the field).

Once you've done that, run this script like so: `python3 insert_strings_update.py --shortname <your_song_shortname>`.

# More tools? TBD
