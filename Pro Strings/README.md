# Pro Strings
<img src="../dependencies/progtr.png" width="20%" height="20%" align="left"> Pro string upgrades allow for all applicable songs to be played in either the Pro Guitar or Pro Bass mode, via the actual instruments' tabs. Every pro string upgrade midi in this repository has been authored by myself, UNLESS stated otherwise in that specific song's upgrades.dta file. Cases of this include, but may not be limited to, the authoring of pro bass tabs in addition to somebody else's pro guitar tabs, or replacing RBHP's optional pro string upgrades' autogenerated Easy/Medium/Hard tabs with manually authored ones.

# Installation
Good news for Xbox 360 players - if you want every available pro string upgrade on this repo, and don't want to build them one by one, there is now a pre-built CON file for you to download and place onto your Xbox! Simply navigate to the Actions tab, click the latest workflow run, and scroll down until you see the CON, titled "RB3PlusProStrPack". Click this, and then a zip file containing the pre-built CON file will be yours.

However, if you are not on Xbox, or want to pick and choose singular pro string upgrades, you will need C3CONTools, and a USB drive if you are playing on a physical game console.

## Xbox 360 (JTAG/RGH)
- Open up C3CONTools, and launch the CON Creator.
- Make sure the root folder is titled "songs_upgrades" and NOT "songs" like it defaults to. Then, within this folder, insert both a pro string's *_plus.mid file and upgrades.dta file. The end file structure should look like this: ![example_CON_structure](../dependencies/example_CON.PNG?raw=true "Example CON structure")
- Name the package whatever you like, then create the package as a LIVE file.
- On your JTAG/RGH Xbox, open the File Manager. Navigate to ```Hdd1/Content/0000000000000000/45410914/00000002```, and paste the LIVE file you created earlier in there.
- Delete your RB3 song cache by navigating back to the ```45410914``` directory, but going to ```00000001``` instead of ```00000002```, and deleting the ```songcache```.
- That's it! Boot up Rock Band 3 and enjoy your upgrade!

## Xbox 360 (Retail)
- Follow the same building steps as stated in the JTAG/RGH guide; however, instead of creating the package as a LIVE file, create it as a CON instead.
- Once you have your CON file, move it to the same place as you would your other custom CONs.
- Also like the JTAG/RGH setup, it's recommended you delete your RB3 song cache. Navigate to your RB3 DLC location on your hard drive and delete the song cache there.

## RPCS3
- Open up your system's file explorer, and navigate to where you have RPCS3 installed. 
- Go to ```dev_hdd0\game\BLUS30463\USRDIR```. Create the folder ```HMX0756``` if it does not exist. Then, navigate inside this folder.
- Inside this folder, if it does not already exist, make a new folder titled ```songs_upgrades```. Navigate inside this folder.
- Paste the *_plus.mid file in the folder, and depending on if you have previously placed upgrades in this folder, do one of the following:
  - If you have never posted an upgrade here before, simply paste the pro string's upgrades.dta file in.
  - If you HAVE posted an upgrade here before, open up the existing upgrades.dta, scroll down to the very bottom, and paste in the contents of the pro strings' upgrades.dta file.
- Finally, open up C3CONTools, and launch the PS3 Converter. Then click Encryption Options --> Encrypt replacement MIDI file(s). Navigate to the ```HMX0756``` folder from your RPCS3 install, and select the pro string's *_plus.mid you placed in there. The midi should now be encrypted and recognizable by RPCS3.
- That's it! Boot up RB3 on RPCS3 and enjoy your upgrade!

## PS3
- In C3CONTools, launch the PS3 Converter. Then click Encryption Options --> Encrypt replacement MIDI file(s). Take the MIDI file from this repository, and encrypt it. You should end up with a file formatted as *_plus.mid.edat. You can then have this on hand for use with an FTP transfer, or put it on a flash drive with the associated upgrades.dta.
- Using a tool on your PS3 like multiMAN or with an FTP connection, open up your PS3's file system. You will need a modded PS3 to do this.
- Go to ```dev_hdd0\game\BLUS30463\USRDIR```. Create the folder ```HMX0756``` if it does not exist. Then, navigate inside this folder.
- Inside this folder, if it does not already exist, make a new folder titled ```songs_upgrades```. Navigate inside this folder.
- Paste the *_plus.mid.edat file in the folder, and depending on if you have previously placed upgrades in this folder, do one of the following:
  - If you have never posted an upgrade here before, simply paste the pro string's upgrades.dta file in.
  - If you HAVE posted an upgrade here before, open up the existing upgrades.dta, scroll down to the very bottom, and paste in the contents of the pro strings' upgrades.dta file.
- That's it! Boot up RB3 and enjoy your upgrade!
