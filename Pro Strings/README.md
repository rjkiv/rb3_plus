# Pro Strings
<img src="../readme_assets/progtr.png" width="20%" height="20%" align="left"> Pro string upgrades allow for all applicable songs to be played in either the Pro Guitar or Pro Bass mode, via the actual instruments' tabs. Every pro string upgrade midi in this repository has been authored by myself, UNLESS stated otherwise in that specific song's upgrades.dta file. Cases of this include, but may not be limited to, the authoring of pro bass tabs in addition to somebody else's pro guitar tabs, or replacing RBHP's optional pro string upgrades' autogenerated Easy/Medium/Hard tabs with manually authored ones.

# Installation
To install a pro strings upgrade, you will need C3CONTools, and a USB drive if you are playing on a physical game console.

## Xbox 360 (JTAG/RGH)
- Open up C3CONTools, and launch the CON Creator.
- Make sure the root folder is titled "songs_upgrades" and NOT "songs" like it defaults to. Then, within this folder, insert both a pro string's *_plus.mid file and upgrades.dta file. The end file structure should look like this: ![example_CON_structure](../readme_assets/example_CON.PNG?raw=true "Example CON structure")
- Name the package whatever you like, then create the package as a LIVE file.
- On your JTAG/RGH Xbox, open the File Manager. Navigate to ```Hdd1/Content/0000000000000000/45410914/00000002```, and paste the LIVE file you created earlier in there.
- That's it! Boot up Rock Band 3 and enjoy your upgrade!

## RPCS3
- Open up your system's file explorer, and navigate to where you have RPCS3 installed. 
- Go to ```dev_hdd0\game\BLUS30463\USRDIR```. Create the folder ```HMX0756``` if it does not exist. Then, navigate inside this folder.
- Paste the *_plus.mid file in the folder, and depending on if you have previously placed upgrades in this folder, do one of the following:
  - If you have never posted an upgrade here before, simply paste the pro string's upgrades.dta file in.
  - If you HAVE posted an upgrade here before, open up the existing upgrades.dta, scroll down to the very bottom, and paste in the contents of the pro strings' upgrades.dta file.
- Finally, open up C3CONTools, and launch the PS3 Converter. Then click Encryption Options --> Encrypt replacement MIDI file(s). Navigate to the ```HMX0756``` folder from your RPCS3 install, and select the pro string's *_plus.mid you placed in there. The midi should now be encrypted and recognizable by RPCS3.
- That's it! Boot up RB3 on RPCS3 and enjoy your upgrade!
