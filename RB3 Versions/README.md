# RB3 Versions
Sometimes, Harmonix/Rhythm Authors/any miscellaneous chart author may choose to map keys audio to guitar or bass, known as "alt-charting". When applying a key upgrade from the "Pro Keys" folder, this key upgrade will leave the alt-charting as is, in order to maintain compatibility with others who have the original charts. However, there are some out there who would prefer no alt-charting in their upgraded songs, preferring to have all key audio mapped to keys. To account for this, you can now download midis from this folder that contain "un-alt charted" versions of the affected instruments for a particular song. By editing your original song's midi file to include these tracks, as well as using the provided .mogg and songs.dta file, you can now play a "proper" RB3 version of your song.
